# Video-Stabilization

This project involves Implementation of [Conference Paper](https://github.com/nvnmangla/Video-Stabilization/blob/main/paper.pdf), 

## Introduction:

Video stabilization using Sparse Optical Flow using a Mesh grid. This includes outlier rejection using median filtering, generating vertex profiles, and smoothening. The project was accomplished by a team of 3 members, which includes Naveen Mangla , [Mahima Arora](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACBA3TsBoA_q_kcTQQXxA5fowvfELuNf-Nw), and [Charu Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB3r70oBDt4ONFnZHCDUyYFGVw_YINTQZcM).
